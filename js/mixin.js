/*
=>a mixin is a class containing methods that can be used by other classes without a need to inherit from it.
=>a mixin provides methods that implement a certain behavior, but we do not use it alone, we use it to add the behavior to other classes.
=>Mixin â€“ is a generic object-oriented programming term: a class that contains methods for other classes.

=>Some other languages allow multiple inheritance. JavaScript does not support multiple inheritance, but mixins can be implemented by copying methods into prototype.
